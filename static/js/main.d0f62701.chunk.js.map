handler, \r\n    while the rest of my team produced a mouse event handler, \r\n    a layer system and a generic loop to run all the games. \r\n    This is where I first learned about dictionaries, \r\n    which I now know as the hashmaps of Python.\r\n    `,\r\n    `\r\n    I then got to use the backbone we created and if/else \r\n    my way into making a minigame: a top-down arcade game where \r\n    you use your short-ranged weapon to kill a number of enemies without getting killed. \r\n    I worked hard on getting the movement where I wanted it to be, with a good amount of \r\n    inertia so that it feels like you’re on a boat (did I mention it had a pirate theme?).\r\n    `,\r\n    `\r\n    I also got a taste of using classes when adding the enemies that \r\n    randomly spawn over time and independently try to target the player.\r\n    `,\r\n    `\r\n    Furthermore I successfully used recursion before learning about it in class, \r\n    though it was inside the game update loop that gets called every frame. \r\n    Needless to say, it was the wrong place and the wrong time, \r\n    but I learned a lot from the resulting mess and re-implementing it.\r\n    `,\r\n    `\r\n    Though this was my only time using Python in a school project, \r\n    most of the skills I learned and got comfortable with would transfer \r\n    to later projects in other languages. \r\n    I also proceeded to study Python in my own time, \r\n    learning the ways of list comprehension and the various functional and object-oriented \r\n    tools the language offers.

Without any support from the school, \r\n        who were recommending Android Studio, we set out to make our first mobile app.\r\n        `,\r\n        `\r\n        Things started out rough for me. \r\n        Running an Android emulator didn’t sit well with my \r\n        laptop and testing directly on my phone didn’t go smoothly either. \r\n        My first commit ended up being some blindly written JavaScript, \r\n        a language I had no previous familiarity with, \r\n        and it needed fixing by my teammates before it ran.\r\n        `,\r\n\r\n        `\r\n        Though with such competent teammates, \r\n        it was a challenge to even find what to work on, \r\n        I did end up finding my niches and getting my \r\n        first taste of React and JavaScript along

school’s newly opened Techlab, \r\n        which was a place to borrow useful gadgets like Arduinos and Hololenses. \r\n        The admin page allowed management of the lab’s inventory of gadgets.\r\n        `,\r\n        `\r\n        Thus along with my first taste of mobile development, \r\n        I also did web development for the first time. \r\n        I took to that quite fervently, given that it was much easier \r\n        to grasp than the rather arcane (at the time) stuff going on at the backend \r\n        and I instantly felt like I could make a real contribution. \r\n

it was an important stepping stone. \r\n        In my next project, I worked with several of the same people, \r\n        but the styling got shoved on to less trusted teammembers while I got a

their bad CSS ended up throwing us some roadblocks. \r\n        More importantly though, I spent the entire time working on actual functionality.\r\n        `,\r\n        `\r\n        This was no small project though. The goal was essentially a fully-featured webshop. \r\n        It needed to manage an inventory of multiple thousands, \r\n        search and filter through it and offer a full buying process all the way up to the order summary. \r\n        It also needed to store a persistent shopping cart \r\n        even when an unregistered user left and re-entered, \r\n        as well as allowing full account management and wishlists for registered users. \r\n        Not to mention our extra deckbuilder feature \r\n        and the challenge of managing the seemingly endless amount of special cases \r\n        that turned out to exist among Magic The Gathering trading cards \r\n        (including multiple card faces on one card and one card face on multiple cards.)\r\n        `,\r\n        `\r\n        This project did turn out to be a long journey indeed, \r\n        and I feel like I really pulled my weight. \r\n        By the end of it, not only had I coded the entire userpage \r\n        and several features on other pages, \r\n        but I had fixed bugs throughout our frontend’s entire codebase \r\n        (our C# backend was a small thing managed by one team member \r\n        which did little more than provide an interface for the database).\r\n        `,\r\n        `\r\n        This was the time when I really learned to step outside \r\n        the bubble of my own task and understand all the code around it. \r\n        From here on out, I could program as a member of a team.\r\n        `,\r\n    ],\r\n    \"A webshop for Magic The Gathering cards\"\r\n    ),\r\n];","import React from \"react\";\r\nimport { Carousel } from \"react-responsive-carousel\";\r\nimport \"react-responsive-carousel/lib/styles/carousel.min.css\";\r\nimport \"../styles/Carousel.css\"\r\nimport { Project, HardCodedProjects } from \"../components/Project\"\r\n\r\nexport default class ProjectCarousel extends React.Component<{}, {mode: \"default\"|\"description\", slide: \"start\"|number}> {\r\n    constructor(props: {}, context: any) {\r\n      super(props, context);\r\n      this.state = {mode: \"default\", slide: \"start\"};\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    setMode(newMode: \"default\"|\"description\") {\r\n      this.setState({mode: newMode})\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    setSlide(newSlide: \"start\"|number, newMode: \"default\"|\"description\") {\r\n      this.setState({slide: newSlide})\r\n      this.setMode(newMode)\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    render() {\r\n      let projects = HardCodedProjects\r\n      let carouselState = \"visible\"\r\n      let descriptionState = \"hidden\"\r\n      \r\n      if (this.state.mode === \"default\"){\r\n        carouselState = \"visible\"\r\n        descriptionState = \"hidden\"\r\n      }\r\n\r\n      else {\r\n        carouselState = \"hidden\"\r\n        descriptionState = \"visible\"\r\n      }\r\n\r\n      return (\r\n        <div>\r\n          <div className = {(carouselState)}>\r\n            <Carousel infiniteLoop useKeyboardArrows>\r\n            \r\n            <div key = {\"landing\"} className=\"project-box\">\r\n                  \r\n                  <img src= {require(\"../images/TemporaryPic.png\")}/>\r\n                    \r\n                  <div className=\"project-textbox\">\r\n                    <p className=\"project-title\">\r\n                      Welcome to my portfolio page.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p className=\"project-text\">\r\n                      My name is Daniel and I believe I'm the quick-learning engineer you need for your next\r\n                      tech project.\r\n                      Click the button labelled \"about me\" for more about me.<br/>\r\n                      <br/>\r\n                      On this page you will find various projects I've worked on and what I've learned\r\n                      while doing them.<br/>\r\n                      <br/>\r\n                      Please click the arrow on the right to browse through my portfolio chronologically\r\n                      or go left to go straight to my latest project.
